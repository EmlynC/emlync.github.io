I work at the intersection between pharmacology, software engineering
and medical devices. Most of time is now spent programming, some of
time is spent distributing high-end biomedical equipment and some my
time is spent on primary pharmacology research (mostly preclinical,
but some clinical).

I run OpenVivo ltd part-time and I consult part-time. My consulting
work is mostly for Metellus AG as their Head of Software Development
for Viditeck AG. My career aim is to work building between tools
(hardware and software) for the academic and industrial pharmaceutical
applications.
