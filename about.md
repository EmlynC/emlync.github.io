Hi, I'm Emlyn Clay.

I work at an intersection between pharmacology, software engineering
and medical/biomedical devices. Most of my time is spent programming,
but some of time is spent distributing high-end biomedical equipment
and some my time is spent on primary pharmacology research (mostly
preclinical, but some clinical).

I run OpenVivo ltd part-time and I consult part-time. My consulting
work is mostly for Metellus AG as their Head of Software Development
for Viditeck AG. My career aim is to work towards building better
tools and products (hardware and software) for the academic and
industrial pharmaceutical applications.
